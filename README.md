# Workspace Ergonomics for Software Engineers (WorkWell)

This project uses deep learning to detect and classify ergonomic postures of software engineers at their desks. By analyzing posture images, the model helps identify whether the posture is good or bad, promoting better health and productivity at work.

## üìå Project Overview

WorkWell is a computer vision-based system that aims to promote workspace health by identifying poor ergonomic postures. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on a balanced dataset of workplace posture images to distinguish between *good* and *bad* postures.

- **Accuracy Achieved**: 96.49%
- **Dataset**: 400 labeled images (200 good posture, 200 bad posture)
- **Model**: CNN (Keras + TensorFlow)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**, **Keras**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** (Data preprocessing)
- **Matplotlib** (Visualization)
